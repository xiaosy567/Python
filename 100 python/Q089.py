# Description: By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th,4th,5th
#              numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].

# Hints:
# Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.
# Use enumerate() to get (index, value) tuple.

li = [12,24,35,70,88,120,155]
l = [x for (i,x) in enumerate(li) if i not in (0,4,5)]
print l
